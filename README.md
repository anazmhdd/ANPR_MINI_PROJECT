# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) & Owner Detail Fetching


The Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) project is an innovative and cost-effective solution designed to enhance vehicle management systems, improve security, and optimize traffic regulation. Leveraging the power of Python and the Open Computer Vision Library (OpenCV), this project provides an accessible alternative to traditional, expensive ALPR systems.

Our system is capable of:  
- Detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates.  
- Extracting detailed information, including owner details.  
- Operating effectively in varied conditions such as noise, low light, and diverse plate fonts and orientations.

By utilizing advanced techniques like contour analysis, character filtering, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the system achieves high accuracy in controlled environments such as institutions, housing societies, and residential complexes.  

## Key Features

- **Open-Source & Cost-Effective:** Built using Python and OpenCV, making advanced ALPR capabilities accessible.  
- **Robust Detection & Recognition:** Handles challenging scenarios like low lighting and varying plate designs.  
- **Scalable Design:** Designed for use in diverse environments with potential for broader applications.  

## Applications

- **Parking Management:** Automating vehicle entry and exit systems.  
- **Traffic Regulation:** Monitoring and enforcing traffic rules.  
- **Security Systems:** Enhancing surveillance in gated communities and institutions.
